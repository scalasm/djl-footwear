# DJL (Deep Java Library)

DJL, Deep Java Library, is a deep learning toolkit created by Amazon to develop machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models 
natively in Java while simplifying the use of deep learning frameworks. DJL provides a set of high-level APIs to train, test and run inference. 

*  Training.java - The code to train the model.
*  Models.java - The code to build the network for training.
*  Inference.java - The code to generate a prediction using the model.

I recently used DJL to develop a footwear classification model and found the toolkit super intuitive and easy to use. DJL APIs abstract commonly used 
functions to develop models and orchestrate infrastructure management. I found the high-level APIs used to train, test and 
run inference allowed me to use my knowledge of Java and the ML lifecycle to develop a model in less than an hour with minimal code.
